                                                       ONLINE AUCTION PLATFORM<br>
                                                       <br>
                An online auction (also electronic auction, e-auction, virtual auction, or eAuction) is an auction held over the internet and accessed by internet connected devices.[1][2][3] Similar to in-person auctions, online auctions come in a variety of types, with different bidding and selling rules.[4]

        eCommerce sales for businesses have been steadily increasing for years, and with the migration of virtually all transactions to digital due to the COVID-19 pandemic, worldwide sales through ecommerce channels such as websites and online marketplaces increased overall in 2020 and beyond.
        
        There are two primary markets for online auctions: business to business (B2B) and business to consumer (B2C). B2C is forecast to have over a 1% annual growth rate, achieving a nearly 22% share of total global retail sales by 2024. B2B ecommerce gross merchandise value showed a similarly steady rate through 2019, as to mirror its retail B2C counterpart.[5]
        
        The largest consumer-to-consumer online auction site is eBay, which researchers suggest is popular because it is a convenient, efficient, and effective method for buying and selling goods.[6]
        
        Despite the benefits of online auctions, the anonymity of the internet, the large market, and the ease of access makes online auction fraud easier than in traditional auctions. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) categorizes online auction fraud reports with online shopping categories.
        Online Auction and Bidding System is the website application where participants can bid for the products and users can upload products for auction. In online auction project that holds online auctions of various products on a website and serves sellers and bidders accordingly. The system is designed to allow customers/users to setup their products for auctions and bidders to register and bid for various products available for bidding. This project developed using HTML and all the record stores in CSS database.

The end goal of the project is to create a fully functional online auction and bidding system that allows users to participate in auctions and place bids on various items
Registration at Online Auction Sites
The first step for both the buyer and seller before participating in an online auction is to register on an online bidding site. There are several online bidding sites available where you can register yourself as a Seller or a Bidder. Registration is required to keep track of the items you bid on or sell.

Listing the Items on the Online Auction Sites
If you are a seller you can list one or more items for sale on the bidding site and set up a starting price for bidding. The seller is expected to give a complete description and specifications of the items on sale. Mostly, a specified time period is set up for bidding. In some cases, the bidding process takes place live on a specific date at a pre-specified time when bidders log in with their IDs and place their bids.
